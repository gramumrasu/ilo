- Allow to specify volumes using `--volume` (the project directory is still automatically mounted)
- Allow to specify labels using `--label`
- `--command` was removed in favor of positional parameters.
You can now just write `ilo some command here` instead of `ilo --command=some --command=command --command=here`.

== link:https://codeberg.org/metio.wtf/ilo/src/tag/1.0.0[1.0.0]

The first public release of `ilo`.
Therefore neither changes nor bugfixes, but rather an initial feature set, that seems to work fine (using podman) and is portable (as portable as podman/docker).

=== Features

- Start single container
- Specify which image to use
- Specify which command to run
- Persist those settings in .rc files
- Support podman/docker

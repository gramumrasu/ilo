`ilo` is using [GitHub](https://github.com/metio/ilo) as its primary source/issue/build environment, however its code is available in other git repositories as well in order to deal with [GitHub outages](https://www.githubstatus.com/).

## Available Mirrors

Mirrors are updated automatically as explained in this [blog post](https://seb.people.metio.wtf/topic/gitlab-the-git-distributor/).

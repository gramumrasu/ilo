## IntelliJ

[IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a popular IDE by [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It allows [several ways](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html) to share settings across team members in a project.

`ilo` stores its IntelliJ settings inside its [git repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-projects.html#share-project-through-vcs) and thus should work out-of-the-box for other IntelliJ users.

In case you have trouble getting `ilo` to work in IntelliJ, take a look at the [help](../../community/help) section.
